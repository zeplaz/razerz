 building up to a larger program, you can find, smaller units, with their tests, (however restructuring has resulted in some broken includes)
... nevertheless, projects should slowly move to unify the parts.
 to find the meat, go to the source folder and check the readmes.

## dependence

REQUIRED:
c++17

##### strongly recommend  you USE GNU G++ version 9.2.1
{clang should work with the makefiles.. see makefiles.note}

#### MAKEFILE/CMAKE NOTES.
cmake files are slowly being added to unit tests. check local folder.
note the cmakes currently are rather linux based, and tailored for current setup.
thus, you may need to pass, dependency paths particularity if using the text_render er.
