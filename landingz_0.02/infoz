    Putting your class definition in a MyWindow.H file.
    Creating a Fl_Box widget in FLUID.
    In the widget panel fill in the "class" field with MyWindow. This will make FLUID produce constructors for your new class.
    In the "Extra Code" field put #include "MyWindow.H", so that the FLUID output file will compile.

You must put glwindow->show() in your main code after calling show() on the window containing the OpenGL window.
